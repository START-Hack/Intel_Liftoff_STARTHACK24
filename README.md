# <p align="center"> AI SpeedRacers with Intel Liftoff for Startups (Side Quest) </p>

## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

Dive into the AI SpeedRacers Quest, your fast track to mastering ML model optimization on the Intel Developer Cloud. This challenge is your gateway to applying Intel‚Äôs advanced techniques for peak efficiency and performance for AI challenges, that could be focused on:
- LLM Fine-Tuning Pipeline Optimization
- Optimized classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning 
- Launching a RAG Chatbot
- Applying an quantization to your model
- And we're not limiting your ideas, just pitch and show us your great idea!
 
Achievement Unlocked:
Craft an optimized model on Intel Developer Cloud, then spotlight it on the HuggingFace model hub, complete with a model card detailing its journey and capabilities on the Intel Developer Cloud. 

Your HuggingFace- model card will feature:
- Model Essentials: Name, description, license, and purpose.
- How-To: Usage instructions.
- Know-How: Limitations and optimizations.
- Proof of Excellence: Key metrics like Accuracy and MAE.
 
Embark on the AI SpeedRacers Quest to not only refine your skills but also to leave a mark on the AI community with your optimized, efficient ML model.
